# Sales Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sales data using Google Colab for data processing and Power BI for visualization. The goal is to derive insights from sales trends, customer behavior, and business performance.

## Files in the Repository
- **IN_SALES_ANALYSIS.ipynb** - Jupyter Notebook (Colab) for data preprocessing, cleaning, and analysis.
- **IN_TT.pbix** - Power BI file containing dashboards and reports for data visualization.


## Technologies Used
- **Google Colab** - Used for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and modeling.
- **Power BI** - Used for building interactive dashboards and visualizations.
- **Pandas & NumPy** - For handling and manipulating datasets.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** - For visualizing trends and patterns.

## Key Features
- Sales trend analysis over time.
- Customer segmentation based on purchasing behavior.
- Revenue and profit margin analysis.
- Power BI dashboards for interactive insights.

## How to Use
1. Open IN_SALES_ANALYSIS.ipynb in Google Colab and run the code to preprocess and analyze sales data.
2. Load IN_TT.pbix in Power BI to explore visual reports and dashboards.
3. Modify the dataset as needed to extract further insights.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement predictive analytics for future sales forecasting.
- Integrate more datasets to improve business intelligence.
- Automate data pipeline for real-time analysis.
